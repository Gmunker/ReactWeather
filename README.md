React Weather Application

I am making this project from the Udemy course: https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course/, which I highly recommend to anyone looking to learn ReactJS. @AndrewMead has a great way of teaching.

During this project I have learned a great set of basic skills along side of an indepth understanding of ReactJS, such as Git, GitHub, Babel, Node.js, Foundation, SASS, and much more.

Thanks for checking out my app, and progress, there will be more coming soon, as I continue the course and do many more.
